# termessages

This is a simple script to display a message in the terminal.

It is intended to be placed in .bashrc to be executed when you open one

The messages are taken from the directory specified in the $path variable in
the code. Feel free to modify that.

You can place in that directory all the messages you want, each one in a
different file.

The script takes one at random and displays it in the center of the
terminal.

If the message does not fit in one line it is not showed
